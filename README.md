# IOT_Pi-Object-and-Face-recognition
A utility to do face and object recognition for a pi robot using TCP protocol

=============================

This project includes implementation of message transfer using TCP protocol.
The data is encapsulated with the content and the metadata.
Here we have used speech syntheis and string processing to implement the ongoing conversation and responses.

We have used Flann matcher and facial recognition to let the agent know of the present circumstances.
